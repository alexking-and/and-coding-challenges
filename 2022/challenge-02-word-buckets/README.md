# Challenge 2 - Word Buckets

## Problem
This week's challenge is to write an algorithm which divides a sentence into 'word buckets', where each bucket contains `n` or fewer characters.
Only complete words can be placed into each bucket.
Spaces count as a character, however you should trim leading and trailing spaces from words as they're placed into buckets.
If a word is too large to fit into a bucket, it should be discarded.

### Example
For the following sentence:

```bucketify("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", 10)```

your algorithm should return:

```["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]```

* [ ] 6 points are awarded for a working algorithm using [this sample problem set](https://pastebin.com/YhrF9YMm)
* [ ] 3 points are awarded for an algorithm in under 500 bytes of code (not including input data)
* [ ] 2 points are awarded for providing a suite of unit tests

## Solution
Language TBC - would like to be functional, but needs to be crushable
