# Challenge 3 - Snake!

## Problem
This week, your task is to re-create the famous arcade game '[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))'.
The game has seen various iterations over the years, but the version re-popularised by Nokia phones in the noughties involves a single player attempting to eat randomly-placed items by running into them with the head of the snake.
Each item eaten makes the snake longer, and the game progressively more difficult.

* [ ] 6 points are awarded for submitting a working, playable version of the game (see below for more)
* [ ] 2 further points are awarded for a game with audio and/or animations
* [ ] 2 further points are awarded for implementing a basic high-score board

### Additional Info
* You're free to decide upon the dimensions of your game area
* The are no restrictions on languages/tools
* The criteria for a 'working' game include a board with bounding walls, a snake which grows each time it eats, and proper detection when the snake has eaten itself

## Solution
Didn't want to repeat a language so soon, but it's using a different framework, so it counts!
I had messed around a bit with Bevy before, but apparently didn't push the repo anyway before clearing out my projects, so I lost that example :'(

Unfortunately I just didn't have the time to finish this, but hey, I ended up with a passable example of a white box moving around a screen, so that's something.
