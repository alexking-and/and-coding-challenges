# Challenge 4 - Connect Four

## Problem
Connect Four is a two-player board game where both players pick a colour (Red or Yellow) and take turns dropping their coloured discs into the top of a 7x6 grid.
The first to connect four discs of the same colour is the winner.
The challenge this week is to implement a game of Connect Four.
Running the game against [these sample sets of moves](https://pastebin.com/JDe8z7Np) should output the correct winner.
If the game is over before the set of moves ends, the game should ignore the remaining moves and return the rightful winner.

* [x] 4 points are awarded for outputting the correct winner for each sample game
* [x] 3 points are awarded for visualising the game on screen (either a proper UI, or as some kind of console-art)
* [ ] 3 points are awarded for creating an interactive game which can be played against a basic computer player

## Solution
Self-care means letting yourself do the challenge in Rust even when you've already used Rust.
Dart & Flutter are ready for a future challenge when I have the time to use them properly!

Test the sample cases using `cargo test`, and run a game with visual representation using `cargo run`.
