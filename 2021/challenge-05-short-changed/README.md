# Challenge 5 - Short Changed

## Problem
Paramjit has opened a small store selling a variety of snacks and candy bars.
Business is great, but he decides it’s time to apply some technology to the store to reduce the amount of effort required when making sales.
Given [a set of coins/notes](https://pastebin.com/gdDPmvY8) in his cash register and [some sample transactions](https://pastebin.com/tUtrC6Qc), your task is to write a program to calculate the smallest number of coins/notes needed to give back the correct amount of change.

* [x] 6 points are awarded for a working calculator.
* [ ] 2 further points are awarded for a solution capable of also returning the largest possible number of coins/notes (i.e. least efficient)
* [x] 2 further points are awarded for a finished solution in under 50 lines of (non-minified) code.

### Notes
[An example problem is provided here](https://pastebin.com/ajJd2MSS).
If it’s not possible to solve any of the problems, your program should indicate this.

## Solution
After failing to finish two challenges in a row, I'm figured I'd be nice to myself and do this one in JavaScript.
As expected, using JS made this a breeze to complete in under 50 lines of code.

I thought maybe getting the least efficient change would be a case of running the same algorithm I used for the main challenge in reverse, but turns out it's not that simple, so maybe I'll give that another try later on.
