  "description": "## Problem This week's challenge is to write an algorithm which divides a sentence into 'word buckets', where each bucket contains `n` or fewer characters. Only complete words can be placed into each bucket. Spaces count as a character, however you should trim leading and trailing spaces from words as they're placed into buckets. If a word is too large to fit into a bucket, it should be discarded.",
