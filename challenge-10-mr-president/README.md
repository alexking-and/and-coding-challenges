# Challenge 10 - Mr President

## Problem
This weekâ€™s problem is simple - in which year were the most US presidents alive? Your task is to programatically answer this question, given [this set of CSV data](https://pastebin.com/UdKNjTmz). These presidents may either have been future presidents, actively serving presidents, or previous presidents.

* [ ] 4 points are awarded for a solution which can present a valid answer (or set of answers if more than one is valid)
* [ ] 3 points are awarded for a solution in under 50 lines of code
* [?] 2 points are awarded for choosing a language/tech unique among other participants
* [x] 1 point is awarded for not using any if statements

## Solution
I picked Kotlin for this challenge to be unique, but unfortunately this turned out to be the wrong choice for a few reasons:
* Getting Kotlin setup without IntelliJ is a pain
* Contrary to what I thought, Kotlin doesn't have ternary statements, so I had to rely on switches and try/catch for control flow
* Kotlin is still a Java-similar language, so conciseness isn't really its thing.

Despite that I managed to get most of the way to the solution, but unfortunately got quite ill so I just haven't had the energy to do the final bits of giving the solution as a range and crushing down the code.
